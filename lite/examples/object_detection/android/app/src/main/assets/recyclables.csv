Cigarette,Cigarette,"Cigarettes are a big litter problem, but you can do your part by recycling the filters. Dispose of every cigarette properly in an ashtray or recycling bin instead of the trash.If you have an ashtray, push the cigarette’s lit end into it until the heat and smoke stop.Collect the cigarette filters in a plastic bag or container separate from other trash if you plan on recycling them.You can also purchase outdoor ashtrays online, from home improvement stores, and from restaurant supply stores. Tips 1: Cigarette filters are made from a non-biodegradable plastic, so recycle whenever you can. 2: Cigarette butts are pollution and may be eaten by animals, so throw them away instead of leaving them on the ground. 3: Recycle cigarette boxes through curbside programs that accept newspaper and other paper products. Warnings: To avoid fires, always extinguish cigarettes before throwing them away.",26%
Unlabeled litter,Unlabeled litter,"This means the trash which is not labeled can be recycle in the way that.Plastic bags– Not recyclable. Straws– Not recyclable. Coffee Cups– you need a special machine; without it, no. Keyboards– maybe, if you get it to the right person.Recycling  is determined by two really important things: the market and city government.Thermoplastics are plastics that can be re-melted and re-molded into new products, and therefore, recycled. However, thermoset plastics “contain polymers that cross-link to form an irreversible chemical bond,” meaning that no matter how much heat you apply, they cannot be remelted into new material and hence, non-recyclable. COFFEE CUPS CAN’T ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED.T.he cups cannot be recycled unless the materials are separated, which is impossible to do by hand and requires a special machine. Glass and metal (including aluminum) can be recycled infinitely without losing quality or purity in the product. Current biodegradable products can only decompose if they are sent to a special factory, where the temperature and humidity is specially controlled, and lumped together with other compostable plastics.",50%
Plastic drink bottle,Bottle,"Recycling plastic water bottles is an essential gesture to apply everyday. It is important to to know the do’s and don’ts of how to recycle to make sure we maintain a healthy ecosystem for generations to come. Put the water bottle cap back on after consuming. Crush your bottle. Bottles must be crushed and all of the air removed. Be sure to replace the cap back on after you have done this. This causes more space to be saved at the processing facility, reducing the need for expansion. You don’t need to spend extra time rinsing out bottles that might have some liquid inside of them. Just make sure they’re empty and that you place them in a recycling bin.Most people make the common mistake of bagging their water bottles and other plastics. Bagged items prevent the process from being completed and adds an extra step to the recycle process. Please place the water bottles in a recycling bin or bin free of any confinements.Think of your plastic bottles as starting its life once you consume it. It wants to do more in its life than end up straight in a landfill or on the side of the street. If you start recycling, you will feel much better about yourself and the environment.",45%
Plastic Film,Plastic bag & wrapper,"Plastic film, such as produce bags, dry cleaning bags, the wrap around paper towels and diapers, and more, can be recycled along with plastic bags.There are a few differences between recycling plastic film and recycling other plastics, like bottles, jars and jugs. The main difference? Except in a few cases, plastic film cannot be recycled in your curbside bin at home. Instead, it must be taken to a drop-off location, like a grocery or other retail store, to be collected for recycling.Plastic bags/wraps typically do not get recycled in curbside bins. Plastic wrap and film packaging are generally #2 and #4 plastic, both of which are recyclable. Most plastic bags are recycled into composite lumber, but can actually become a wide variety of products. Drop-off locations and curbside pick-up programs for these plastics are available all over the country.et or food-soiled plastic wrap and film should not be recycled as it can cause costly contamination during the recycling process.Tips 1: All items should be clean and free of food. 2: Tear off sticky labels where possible. 3: As a general rule, if you can stretch the film then it can be recycled. 4: Compostable and biodegradable bags are not designed to be recycled and if they enter the recycling system can potentially cause quality issues in the recycled material.",84%
Other plastic,Other plastic,"Plastic juice bottles, shampoo bottles, and yogurt tubs can all be recycled the same way, right? Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. When looking for how to recycle plastics, you’ll soon find that while these are all commonly recycled plastic items, they all have entirely different plastic recycling symbols. PETE or PET: Polyethylene terephthalate is usually accepted by most curbside recycling providers. HDPE: High-density polyethylene is often accepted by curbside recycling providers. However, some providers will only accept bottles, not liners or bags. PVC or V: Polyvinyl chloride is typically not accepted by curbside recycling providers. It’s occasionally accepted by plastic lumber makers. LDPE: Unfortunately, low-density polyethylene isn’t accepted by most curbside programs. It can, however, be brought to store drop-off locations. PP: Smaller polypropylene items, including bottles and toys, are sometimes accepted by curbside recycling programs. PS: ome curbside providers will accept polystyrene items, but check your local recycling regulations before putting any of it out. Miscellaneous: Other plastics like acrylic, nylon, and fiberglass.These items are usually not accepted by curbside providers in most locations.",45%
Drink can,Can,"Metal packaging is widely recycled. To check whether you can put cans, tins and foil into you home recycling enter your postcode below.Many of the food and drink products we buy are packaged in cans made from either aluminium or steel and both of these materials can be recycled after we have finished with them to make either new cans or other products. Aluminium cans are shredded, removing any coloured coating. They are then melted in a huge furnace. Steel cans are put into the furnace where molten iron is added. Oxygen is then blasted into the furnace which heats up to around 1700°C. The liquid metal is poured into a mould to form big slabs which are then rolled into coils. These coils are used to make all sorts of steel products such as bikes, cars, bridges, paperclips or even new food and drink cans. Tips 1: Empty and rinse items - left over foods or liquids can contaminate other recyclables. 2: You can leave labels on - these are removed in the recycling process. 3: Metal lids and caps on glass containers, e.g. metal jam jar lids, can be left on to recycle with glass. These are different types of metal to cans/tins/aerosols and are recycled in a different way. By putting the lids/caps back on glass jars and bottles it reduces the chance of them getting lost through the sorting process. 4: The plastic ring joiners that come with multi-packs of drinks cans can be recycled together with plastic film and carrier bags at collection points of larger supermarkets.",85%
Plastic bottle cap,Bottle cap,"Plastic caps don’t biodegrade, meaning it will take hundreds of years for them to decompose in a landfill. If you know your local program doesn’t accept caps, you should try to contain them in a plastic bag before putting them in your garbage bin. That way, they are less likely to end up as marine debris. If you’re at the beach and there are no recycling or trash bins around, take the bottles home with you instead of leaving them as litter.Assuming you left the cap on the bottle, the first step in the recycling process is to separate the bottles and caps into their individual resins. The material recovery facility (MRF) will use a pressurized system to expel caps and flatten bottles. Plastics are then soaked in water, where the bottle (made of #1 plastic) will sink and the cap (#2 or #5 plastic) will float.Recyclers will shred the #2 or #5 plastic into flakes, which are washed, rinsed and dried. Flakes are then melted into pellets, which are transported to a manufacturer to make new plastic caps or other materials, such as casing for car batteries, storage containers or reusable plastic bags.",30%
Other plastic wrapper,Plastic bag & wrapper,"Plastic bags, wraps, and films can't be recycled in your curbside recycling bins. But, you can take some of these items to local retail stores where they collect plastic grocery bags for recycling. Plastic wrap and film packaging are generally #2 and #4 plastic, both of which are recyclable. Most plastic bags are recycled into composite lumber, but can actually become a wide variety of products. Drop-off locations and curbside pick-up programs for these plastics are available all over the country.  Use reusable bags (such as the supermarket 'green bags') or a backpack for your shopping – just remember to take them with you to shops!
Instead of purchasing purpose-made plastic bags for your household rubbish, put dry or clean items straight into your bin. For wet or smelly garbage, such as non-compostable food scraps, try wrapping it in old bread bags, the bags from inside cereal boxes, or even a sheet of newspaper.
Reuse any plastic bags that you do have, and recycle them in the REDcycle collection bins at the supermarket if they're damaged.",84%
Plastic straw,Straw,"Typically no one re-uses uses plastic straws Do check with your local council or recycling scheme as to what types of plastic they accept. The labelling can be all a bit complicated and is an issue in itself. There are many different types and varying policies in regard to the collection and recycling of plastics. A little local knowledge will help you to make the right decisions about how to recycle plastic straws in your local area. and they are not dishwasher safe which doesn’t help. Alternative eco-friendly straws made of metal or glass can go in the dishwasher no problem and be reused.  Even if they are able to recycled in your local area, there’s another problem. They are often too light to be recycled. Because of their weight and size plastic straws tend to drop through the screens that sift out the heavier items in mechanised recycling plants. As a result they then still end up in a landfill, or worse, our seas. However, takeaways by definition are often eaten in our cars, by beaches, parks and so on. When disposing of plastic straws in a public space or bin they will almost certainly make their way into landfill. Once in landfill plastic straws can take up to 200 years to break down and decompose. Rather than throwing your plastic straws aways you can also use them for a range of home decorations or turn them into eco-bricks.",20%
Disposable plastic cup,Cup,"Whilst made predominantly out of paper, most disposable cups are coated with a layer of polyethylene plastic. These are not recyclable and will release methane gas when sent to landfill, a greenhouse gas 21 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Honeycomb wall lamps : This lamp is made by cutting the cups into equal proportions and then arranging them in an order which looks pretty cool. This is a complete Eco-friendly gadget and is quite simple to make and also is affordable.It’s very rare that you will find a curbside recycling program that accepts paper cups, even if they are lined with bio-plastic. Some cities in California will accept paper cups with food waste, but you’ll want to check first. You can remove the paper sleeve for coffee cups and recycle that with corrugated cardboard. The plastic lid should be recyclable if your local program accepts #1-7 plastics in non-bottle form. The straw or stirrer should be thrown away. If you have a backyard compost bin and you purchase bio-based paper cups, you can try to compost them. The paper will break down, but you may have difficulty with the plastic lining.",25%
Aluminium foil,Aluminium foil,"Foil is made from the same material as soda cans (aluminum), but since it’s most often contaminated with food waste or combined with plastic (like with yogurt tops), there’s no guarantee you can recycle it with your aluminum cans. You want to make sure that aluminum foil is as clean as possible before recycling. While burns and holes won’t affect the recycling market, you’ll want to remove any meats or sauces from the foil. If you’re recycling aluminum foil that you bought and used for storage, separate the foil from the paperboard box and corrugated tube before recycling. If foil is combined with other materials (such as in drink boxes, candy wrappers and yogurt tops) and can’t be separated, you’ll want to throw it away. Foil mixed with other materials is considered recycling contamination. Combine all sheets of foil into one ball. This will keep the material easily separated from other products, and also prevent it from blowing away (aluminum foil is a very light material). Find a drop-off location for aluminum foil near you using our Recycling Locator. While most cities will accept aluminum cans at the curb, you’ll want to verify acceptance of aluminum foil. The risks of contamination will often make it undesirable for local recyclers.",80%
Other carton,Carton,"Cartons like those used for milk, juice, soy or grain milk and soup are recyclable. Made from mostly paper, the high-quality materials used in cartons make them very desirable for remanufacturing into new products. Put your food and beverage cartons in the bin. It might seem like a small action, but every recycled item helps to preserve our planet's natural resources. When recycled, cartons can go on to be transformed into new paper products as well as eco-friendly building materials rather than end up in a landfill. Milk, soup, juice, wine and broth are just some of the products packaged in cartons that you’ll find in your nearby grocery store — and they're all recyclable!. 1: Empty your carton of any remaining food or liquid. 2: Toss your carton – without flattening it – into the recycling bin along with all your other recyclables such as cans, plastic and bottles. Keep the cap on. If you have a straw, push it back into the carton before recycling. 3:  Take 'em to the curb. On your designated recycling pick-up day, take your recycling to the curb to be collected.",35%
Glass bottle,Bottle,"Most large cities accept glass in their curbside recycling programs, but you’ll want to verify acceptance locally. Due to the costs of transportation, risks of breakage, and low commodity value, some communities choose not to accept glass.. Glass bottles are frequently used to package liquids like soda, juice, beer, and wine, and are accepted in most curbside recycling programs. Glass bottles represent the quickest recycled-packaging process, as a bottle can be recycled and back on store shelves in 30 days. 1:  Do your best to not break glass bottles, as there is no market for recycling broken glass. 2:  You can leave the label/foil on, but many recyclers will ask you to separate the metal caps. This is partly to ensure that all liquids are removed. Remove all wine corks. 3: Don’t worry about non-liquids in the bottle, such as a lime wedge in a beer bottle or bits of cork in a wine bottle. Remove any non-containers from your glass recycling, such as Pyrex, glassware, windows, and mirrors. These glass products can’t be recycled with containers.",45%
Paper cup,Cup,"It’s very rare that you will find a curbside recycling program that accepts paper cups, even if they are lined with bio-plastic. Some cities in California will accept paper cups with food waste, but you’ll want to check first.. Your classic to-go coffee or soda cup is designed for one-time use, but unfortunately recycling at this point is basically nonexistent in the U.S. That’s because all cups are lined with a thin coating of plastic that can’t be easily separated during the recycling process. The most innovation on paper cup disposal has come in the field of composting, and that is still limited at best. 1: Unfortunately, odds are pretty good that you’ll have to throw the paper cup away. However, there is better news for its accessories. 2: You can remove the paper sleeve for coffee cups and recycle that with corrugated cardboard. The plastic lid should be recyclable if your local program accepts #1-7 plastics in non-bottle form. The straw or stirrer should be thrown away. 3: If you have a backyard compost bin and you purchase bio-based paper cups, you can try to compost them. The paper will break down, but you may have difficulty with the plastic lining.",25%
Styrofoam piece,Styrofoam piece,"Polystyrene, commonly known as Styrofoam, is recyclable in some parts of the country, yet most Materials Recovery Facilities still do not accept it as part of their recycling program. ... Please refrain from putting any form of Styrofoam in your recycling bin. Styrofoam is the household name for EPS, a kind of plastic. To throw away Styrofoam, remove any recyclable pieces, then break down sheets or blocks into smaller bits you can put in your regular trash can. To recycle, make sure you have plain white Styrofoam marked with the triangular recycling symbol. Contact local agencies to see if they’ll take it. If recycling isn’t an option, reuse your Styrofoam or repurpose it for creative DIY projects. 1: Remove any recyclable parts attached to the Styrofoam. 2: Break the Styrofoam into smaller pieces for ease. If you have large foam blocks or sheets, cut them into smaller cubes. They'll fit easily into a trash bag, and you might be able to fit more in a single bag. 3: Contact your local recycling program for information on Styrofoam drop-offs.",12%
Pop tab,Pop tab,"Pop Tab Collection Program. Little things can make a big difference. You can help support the Ronald McDonald House of Durham in North Carolina by collecting the little tabs you pull to open soda, soup or other aluminum cans. The funds generated from recycling these aluminum gems help offset the House's expenses.Start collecting! You can collect the tabs in any container, like milk cartons or Pringles cans. Contact us and we’ll send you special labels for your container. Although the whole aluminum can is valuable, the tab is cleaner and smaller, making it easier to collect in large quantities than whole cans. The tab of a standard soda can is made of high quality, high-grade aluminum. By itself, it doesn’t mean much, but when you pull together, pop-tabs add up and become a valuable donation. It's All Aluminum
There are rumors that the pull tabs on cans are the only part of the can made from pure aluminum. According to Alcoa, aluminum from recycled cans, tabs included, is identical to aluminum smelted from virgin ore. The can itself is every bit as valuable and recyclable as the tab.",74%
Normal paper,Paper,"The most important thing for recycling paper is that there is NO contamination in the recycling bin. This means that bottles and cans need to be empty of all liquids. Other food containers like yogurt tubs and pasta sauce jars should be rinsed. Any food, soda, beer, etc. that gets on the paper renders it unrecyclable and can ruin and entire bale.  After you put paper in your recycling bin, it’s taken to a recycling center where contaminants such as plastic, glass or trash are removed. If your local recycling program accepts mixed paper, it will most likely accept sticky notes. Paper mills that process mixed paper are able to remove adhesives. To be on the safe side, check with your local program to make sure sticky notes aren’t a problem.",64%
Plastic lid,Lid,"For plastic bottles, you need to ask your local recycling program whether caps are accepted before trying to recycle them with the bottle. Some will ask you to leave them on, some accept caps but want them separated, and some will ask you to throw them away. Do you take the cap off your plastic bottles because you think that it will make it easier for it to be recycled once it reaches the recycling plant? Well you can start leaving the lids on because it’s not true. The plastic bottles, complete with lids, are ground up and put through a water bath. As the lids are usually made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), they tend to float, whereas the plastic bottles, made from PET, are heavier and they will sink. This makes it easy for the different types of material to be separated so they can be recovered and turned into new items. Sadly, many people assume that the lids can’t be recycled, and they throw them in with their general waste. This can often mean that they end up in landfill, or even worse, in our oceans and on our beaches, where they can do untold damage. Plastic bottle lids are one of the most common items of litter found on beaches. Plastic takes many years to degrade, if indeed it does at all, and in the meantime, bottle lids and caps can become choking hazards for wildlife, especially fish and birds.",30%
Food Can,Can,"Most cities will accept metal cans (aluminum and steel) in the curbside recycling program. You’ll want to verify acceptance through your program as well as any preparation instructions, such as whether to rinse or crush cans. Empty and rinse out steel food cans before recycling them. Clean out an old food can and use it to store pencils, pens, or paintbrushes. Steel food cans can be recycled over and over again because they don’t lose any of their quality or functionality during the recycling process. If it can mold or get stinky, rinse it before you put it in the recycling. Beverage containers (soda bottles, beer cans/bottles) do not need to be rinsed. Only place plastics #1 & #2 in the recycling.  If it’s plastic and you can squish or crumple it, toss it in the trash. No plastic film products can be recycled curbside. If it’s contaminated with food or sticky, toss it in the trash.",85%
Drink carton,Carton,"Cartons are a composite packaging material - in other words they are not made from paper alone but comprise of about 75% paper, 20% plastic (polyethylene) and 5% aluminium foil (for long-life products). 1: Drinks cartons are sorted automatically or by hand in a sorting center. 2: Just like waste paper, drinks cartons are submerged in water, allowing the paper fibers to be released from the plastic and aluminum layers. 3: The released cardboard fibers are then further recycled in the same way as regular paper or cardboard; The plastic can be recycled or used as a source of energy for cement ovens, and the aluminum can be recycled for use in other products. The cardboard fibers from drinks cartons can be used in the production of household paper (kitchen roll, paper tissues, and toilet paper), cardboard boxes, paper bags, and envelopes. Plastics can also be used as a source of energy in the drying process in papermaking. Aluminum can serve as a binding agent in cement or can be recovered as a raw material.",35%
Disposable food container,Plastic container,"1: Make sure all items are rinsed and clean before going into the recycling bin. Absolutely no food, liquids, or other contamination allowed. Yes, that means that the bottom of your pizza box needs to go in the compost (or the trash). You can, however, tear-off any non-greasy parts for disposable in the recycling bin. 2:  Separate glass jars from their metal lids. 3: Inquire about how to recycle the lids of plastic bottles. In bigger, mixed systems, it’s often preferred to keep them together, but many smaller programs only want the bottle, so the lid should go in the trash. 4: Keep aluminum foil, plastic utensils, Styrofoam containers, plastic wrap, or plastic wrappers (including baggies and bags) OUT of the recycling bin. Those items need to go into the trash unless your recycling program specifically gives the green light. 5: If you must collect your recycling in a plastic bag, use a clear or see-through blue bag. 6: Compostable plastics are great but they don’t belong in a recycling bin (and not even in a home composting bin – only industrial or commercial composting options can take these items).",55%
Metal bottle cap,Bottle cap,"The top can be recycled as long as it’s placed in the recycling bin separate from the jar. Examples: tops from pasta sauce jars, jam jars, Ball canning jars (rings and discs).  Small metal bottle caps can no longer be placed in your recycling bin loose. They fall through the spaces in between conveyor belts at the Central Landfill’s recycling facility and cause mechanical problems. However, these bottle caps can be recycled. Place these bottle caps in an aluminum soup can until it is half full. Then, crimp the top of the can so that the bottle caps are trapped. Toss the crimped can in the recycling bin. Examples: beer bottle caps, soda bottle caps, Snapple bottle caps, wine bottle caps and olive oil bottle caps. 1: Remove metal lids from jelly, mustard, and other jars. 2: Remove aluminum twist-off tops from wine, olive oil, and sparkling water bottles. 3: If you’re inclined to press the ridged metal caps back on beer and soda bottles, don’t. After dropping empty, lid- and cap-free glass containers into your recycling bin, what do you do with the metal caps and lids? Metal is definitely recyclable. But lids and caps are often undesirable in mixed recycling — with some exceptions — because most equipment doesn’t efficiently sort and separate them. If your curbside provider doesn’t accept metal lids and caps at all, your next bet is to find a nearby metal recycling facility.  And to avoid wasting a trip, call to confirm they’ll accept your items before you make the delivery.",30%
Single-use carrier bag,Plastic bag & wrapper,"Most plastic bags are made from high-density polyethylene (#2 plastic), but the thinner-material bags (such as produce bags) are made from low-density polyethylene (#4 plastic). The recycling collection supply is abundant, mostly through collection bins at grocery stores. 1: Remove anything inside the bags, such as receipts, stickers, or crumbs. All these items will contaminate your bag load. 2: Keep a bag collection bin in your house, such as one big garbage bag for all bags. Since they compact easily, you should be able to fit 50 to 100 plastic bags in one garbage bag. 3: Make sure any bags you are recycling have a #2 or #4 plastic symbol on them. If not, you can’t be sure what plastic resin the bag is made from, so you’ll want to reuse it instead, before eventually throwing it away. Plastic bag recycling involves chipping the bags into pellets. While pellets can then be reprocessed into new bags, they will most likely be shipped to a company like Trex to be manufactured into plastic lumber. Believe it or not, black plastic bags are harder to recycle and sometimes omitted from store collection bins. This is because the plastic is dyed and produces dark pellets, which limits the reprocessing options.",84%
Crisp packet,Plastic bag & wrapper,"Crisp packets are not currently recyclable in home recycling collections and should be either recycled via Terracycle's Crisp Packet Recycling Scheme or put in your rubbish bin.  1. Drop off your crisp packets at your nearest public drop-off location. Find your nearest public drop-off location on the interactive map above and drop off your crisp packets. 2: Set up a public drop-off location. If you don’t have a public drop-off location nearby, you could set one up somewhere that’s accessible to members of the public, such as a community centre, shop or other public space (please ensure you have permission from whoever administers the site). But because we are always looking to minimise the environmental impact of our schemes, you need to be confident you can collect a minimum of 8kg of crisp packets every six months – that’s around 1,600 packets. This will help reduce the number of trips needed by vans picking up shipments. Please make sure your packets are completely empty before dropping them off or sending your shipments.

Plastic utensils,Plastic utensils,"Truth be told, plastic plates and silverware (labeled with #6 underneath as their resin identification code) are recyclable, and many curbside recycling programs accept them along with other types of plastic, but many don’t, and that’s because it’s simply not cost-effective. Plastic utensils can be real time savers when it comes to cleanup--just throw them away. But if you're environmentally conscious and wonder if you can recycle those plastic spoons and forks, the answer is yes and no. Wash and reuse plastic utensils rather than throwing them away. Other reuses for plastic utensils include using them for craft projects, plant supports for new seedlings, toys (for kids playing ""restaurant""), kids' lunchboxes (make sure they bring the home to wash and reuse) and cutting knives for clay. Biodegradable utensils are made from corn and degrade after about 100 days in a landfill. Find these utensils from companies who manufacture environmentally safe products.",12%
Other plastic bottle,Bottle,"Plastic bottles make life so much easier. They're lightweight and easy to hold, and they're also strong and hard to break. A plastic bottle is the best way to contain and carry many kinds of liquid, from water and soft drinks to oil to household cleaners and baby formula. Recycling takes many steps. First, the bottles have to be collected from homes, businesses, and other sites. Then, every plastic bottle must be separated from metal, glass, and other things that people put into recycle bins. The plastic bottles are also sorted by the type of plastic they're made from. Then, the bottles are cleaned remove any food, liquid, or chemical residue.
Next, all of the bottles are ground up and shredded into flakes. Finally, they are melted down and formed into small pellets, each about the size of a grain of rice. The pellets are bundled up and sold to companies that can be melt them and make them into many different products. Just think of all of the plastic toys, tools, electronic gadgets, and other plastic things in your own home. Many of these are made with recycled plastic.  5 best to resue and recycle plastic bottle are 1: Create Recycled Plastic Bottle Supply CupsCreate Recycled Plastic Bottle Supply Cups. 2: Reuse Coffee Creamer Containers for Snack Storage 3: Start an Herb Garden With Empty 2-Liter Bottles 4: Create a Piggy Bank Made From a Reused Plastic Bottle. 5: Turn Plastic Bottle Trash Into a Trash Can.",45%
Corrugated carton,Carton,"Cardboard can be recycled five to seven times and is a generally straightforward and easy material to recycle. In 2014, 96 percent of Americans had access to community curbside and/or drop-off recycling for cardboard boxes. Tips 1: Remove any box packing materials such as packing peanuts or Styrofoam. 2: You don’t need to worry about removing any tape or labels from your cardboard boxes. They will be removed in the recycling process. 3: If your box is dented, bent, ripped or damaged, that’s okay. It can still be recycled as long as it is dry and clean. 4: Keep your boxes dry. If your boxes get wet allow them to dry before recycling them. 5: Keep your boxes clean and away from food products such as oil and grease! A greasy or heavily food-stained box cannot be recycled. 6: Flatten your cardboard boxes or rip them up before placing them in your recycling bin or cart. This will save space.It is important to note that there are two types of cardboard: corrugated cardboard and paperboard. Paperboard is the thinner of the two and is used to make things like cereal boxes, shoe boxes, juice containers and milk cartons. Corrugated cardboard is the stronger, thicker of the two and is primarily used to make packaging boxes and even furniture. ALL cardboard is recyclable, but when it comes to your juice containers, pizza boxes and milk cartons, separate rules may apply, so check your local municipality for rules and tips.",35%
Paper bag,Paper bag,"Plastic bags have their problems but so do paper bags. Although paper bags do degrade much faster than plastic bags, it takes nearly double the resources to create a paper bag than one made out of plastic. That’s why reusable products are better than paper or plastic bags. Pretty much all paper carrier bags can be recycled because they are, well, made of paper. This can either be bio-degraded or can be pulped and turned into new paper carrier bags. Yes, these bags are extremely environmentally friendly. Paper can be easily recycled, so long as it is free from things such as plastic coatings, ink and other contaminants. If it is unadulterated from its original form, then they can usually be recycled. Such bags can be recycled in many ways. ‘Recycling’ of paper covers many things. From being pulped and turned into new bags to shredding for use as filler in other packaging products. It can also involve being turned into cardboard, or it can even mean being composted or bio-degraded. To recycle paper containers into paper, the bags must be shredded, boiled and turned back into paper pulp. This can then be pressed to remove water and to bond it together and rolled out into new sheets of paper. This can then be used to make new bags and other paper goods – or used more thickly to make cardboard. Bags that feature handles made of a material other than that of the bag can also be problematic to recycle. Although, so long as they are bio-degradable handles made of card or string – attached with organic glue – these bags can be composted. The other way to recycle paper sacks is to reuse them. Grocery shopping bags can be used more than once, assuming they haven’t been torn or damaged or been spilt on. Other forms of paper sacks and bags used in industry settings can also be reused – not least as rubbish bags.Ultimately, paper containers can also be used to collect organic waste waiting to be added to the compost bin or taken away by the local authorities to be recycled.",64%
Garbage bag,Plastic bag & wrapper,"Not only does the bag not get recycled,  It is also possible that the recyclables in the bag do not get recycled. If recyclables are put in garbage bags in recycling bins or toters, the recyclables may be perceived as garbage and be landfilled rather than recycled. In addition, putting your recyclables in plastic bags, requires extra man power at a recycling center as the garbage bag requires the workers at the transfer station to open the bags and then separate the recyclables. This increases both the cost of our recycling system and also the possibility that the recyclables will be treated as garbage. Many kinds of plastic bags are recyclable, but not in the bins or toters that are in our local villages’ homes, business districts, or schools. Plastic bags may be recycled at local grocery stores all year round. Please make an effort to reduce your use of plastic bags as much as possible by using reusable grocery and shopping bags but and when you do recycle plastic bags, make sure to do so at your local market where they are properly recycled.",84%

Foam food container,Plastic Container,"ou can't recycle foam food containers. Basically, it’s because nobody wants to buy recycled foam food containers. At least not at a price that makes financial sense for recycling companies. Recycling may have many environmental benefits, but it’s driven by economics. You can make big bucks selling recycled plastics, metals and papers. Expanded polystyrene foam, not so much.Recyclers condense recyclable materials into bales that are then sold by weight. The polystyrene foam used in these items is about 95 percent air, which makes transporting it very expensive. “The economics are difficult and even the environmental impacts of transporting a truckload of lightweight polystyrene could be questionable,” said Nicole Fornof, communications and municipal relations manager for Waste Management, the company that runs Monroe County's curbside recycling program.",55%
Aerosol,Can,"Around 60% of aerosols are made from tinplated steel and approx 40% are made from aluminium. Both of these metals are recyclable. Aerosols also contain some small plastic and rubber components including the lid, valve and dip tube which are extracted in the recycling process. 1: Around 60% of aerosols are made from tinplated steel and approx 40% are made from aluminium. Both of these metals are recyclable. Aerosols also contain some small plastic and rubber components including the lid, valve and dip tube which are extracted in the recycling process. 2: Do not pierce, crush or flatten aerosol cans . 3: Detach any loose or easily removable parts, such as the lid, and dispose of them with the rest of your recycling . Aerosol cans are used to store everything from food to bathroom products to paint. While the can itself has the same value as other metal cans, the pressurized air inside and potentially hazardous contents make recycling a bit more complicated. Tips 1: Do your best to use up all the product inside. If the can still has product inside, even if it’s nonhazardous product like whipped cream, your recycling program will not accept it. The easiest way to make sure it’s empty is to shake the can and listen for liquid inside, or spray until nothing comes out. 2: DO NOT puncture a hole in the can to remove any remaining product, as the can will explode and hurt you. You should also not attempt to remove the spray nozzle on top of the can. 3: Verify whether your community accepts aerosol cans with other metal cans, or whether they are classified as household hazardous waste (HHW). There are separate disposal options for each.  Find a drop-off location for aerosol cans near you using our Recycling Locator.",85%
Magazine paper,Paper,"Both books and magazines fall under the category of mixed paper, which also includes catalogs and phone books. While mixed paper has a lower commodity value (and thus a smaller recycling market) than items like newspapers, office paper and corrugated cardboard, most paper mills in the U.S. will recycle mixed paper. 1:  For magazines, you don’t need to remove anything from inside the magazine, such as staples, the cardstock ads or even perfume samples. You can also leave the cover and binding. 2: If the magazine came in a plastic bag, you’ll want to remove and recycle this separately. 3: For paperback books, you can recycle the book whole, including the binding. For hardcover books, you’ll need to remove the cover because it has non-paper components. 4: If either your books or magazines have gotten wet or the paper has turned tan or brown, they should be thrown away with your household trash, as there is no recycling market for this material. Most curbside recycling programs accept magazines and paperback books as mixed paper. Some programs specifically exclude hardcover books because of the binding, unless you remove it. You definitely want to check with your local program, though.",64%
Tissues,Paper,"Can you put tissue paper in the recycling bin? Sure, you came to work sick, just blew your nose, and the nearest bin just happens to be the office paper recycling bin.

Meanwhile, tissue boxes and the cardboard rolls that paper towel comes on can be recycled. echnically, Tissue Paper Has Already Been Recycled

Egg carton,Carton,"Only clean, dry egg cartons can be put in recycling. If you place eggs back in the carton after cracking them, the carton is no longer recyclable: food residue is a contaminant for paper and plastic recycling. First, any egg carton that has been contaminated with food (most likely eggs) cannot be recycled. Food waste can contaminate recycled paper, which is why all recycled items need to be clean. If you put your cracked eggshells back into your egg carton after cracking your eggs, it can't be recycled. Cardboard egg cartons can typically be recycled. However, some recycling centers don’t accept egg cartons of any material, so you have to check with them to be safe. There are likely two reasons for this. Unlike cardboard, styrofoam egg cartons typically cannot be recycled. Although more and more recycling centers are accepting them, the majority of them still reject them. If your local, curbside recycling doesn’t take them, you can likely send them back to the manufacturer to be recycled. What to Do with Egg Cartons? 1 – Compost Them
If your containers are made of cardboard, one of the best disposal options is to compost them. Egg cartons are a brown material (rich in carbon), so they provide a great addition to your compost pile to balance out your carbon-rich items. 2 – Hold Paint If you or your children like to paint small objects or make small paintings, what better way to keep your paint colors separated than an egg carton? The shape and size of each compartment is just about perfect for holding a small amount of paint. 4 – Give Them to a Local Farmer
A great way to get another use out of your egg cartons is to give them to a local chicken farmer. As long as your cartons are clean, they will likely take them off of your hands to be reused for new eggs.",35%

To recycle Styrofoam, call your local recycling program to find a drop-off site for Styrofoam in your area.

Several sportswear brands recycle shoes, including Nike, which runs a Reuse-a-Shoe As part of this scheme, old shoes are transformed into everything from new footwear to large scale sports surfaces. Recycling your shoes might not be as difficult as you think. A few years ago Nike partnered with the National Recycling Corporation to create the Reuse-a-Shoe program. Under this program, Nike takes old athletic shoes of any brand and grinds them into a material used to resurface athletic fields, courts, tracks and playgrounds.

Food waste,Food waste,"Many councils now collect food waste, which can be recycled in several ways including:
In-vessel composting involves mixing food waste with garden waste – shredding it and then composting it in an enclosed systemfor around 2-4 weeks (temperatures of up to 70°C speed up the process and ensure any harmful  microbes are killed off). The material is then left outside to mature for a further 1-3 months with regular turning and checks to ensure quality before going on to be used as soil conditioner.
Anaerobic Digestion uses microorganisms  to break down food waste, animal manure, slurries and energy crops in the absence of oxygen, inside an enclosed system. As it breaks down it gives off methane, which is collected and converted into biogas and used to generate electricity, heat or transport fuels. It also creates a nutrient-rich digestate that can be used as a fertiliser for agriculture and in land regeneration.  Tips 1: Don't forget to make the most of your food and drink and try to avoid wasting food in the first place. For ideas, recipes and simple tips visit Love Food Hate Waste. You could also try to compost at home.  2:  A food waste caddy in your kitchen can help you to separate out your food waste for recycling and composting. This can be emptied into your compost bin or council food waste bin every couple of days. 3: Your council may recommend that you line your food waste caddy with a liner or newspaper. Only use liners that are recommended by your council as some may not break down in the composting process. 4: Where possible keep your bins out of direct sunlight and keep the bin lid closed.",10%
Metal lid,Lid,"Metal lids are fine for recycling. You can either leave a bit of the lid attached and bend it into the can, or plop them down in the can's bottom and give the can a little pinch. Straws should be placed in the trash bin. Metal is definitely recyclable. But lids and caps are often undesirable in mixed recycling — with some exceptions — because most equipment doesn't efficiently sort and separate them. During sorting, caps and lids often wind up with glass shards Remove metal lids from jelly, mustard, and other jars. Remove aluminum twist-off tops from wine, olive oil, and sparkling water bottles. If you’re inclined to press the ridged metal caps back on beer and soda bottles, don’t. After dropping empty, lid- and cap-free glass containers into your recycling bin, what do you do with the metal caps and lids?

Glass jar,Glass jar,"Can you recycle glass food jars?
No, not all glass products are recyclable. Glass used in food packaging, such as iced tea bottles and salsa jars, is recyclable and should not be tossed in the garbage. Glass cookware and storage containers are not recyclable, however.  Glass can be recycled over and over again, and virtually every city and town has access to recycling options. Glass is one of the most common items included in curbside collection programs, although most communities require you to separate glass from other items for safety reasons. If glass is not accepted through your curbside program, your local recycling center almost certainly takes it. 1800Recycling’s recycle search tool can help you find a recycling location near you. Be sure to remove any lids from your jars and rinse them well before putting them in your recycling bin. Most jar lids cannot be recycled, although if you put metal canning rings around home-canned products, those can be reused indefinitely. Lids should not be reused in canning, but if you use jars to store other items (like rice, pasta or iced tea) you can reuse the lids for that purpose. Do not include any other types of glass with your jars. Items like drinking glasses, Pyrex pans, blenders, window glass and mirrors have different properties and cannot be recycled with jars. Mixing these different types of glass will result in unusable glass that can damage equipment at recycling facilities. If you take your glass to a recycling center, be sure and sort it by color if given the option. Green, brown and clear glass separated by color is easier to recycle and can fetch a higher price from recyclers.",13%

If you’re not sure, it’s better to be safe and dispose of your Tupperware and other plastic containers in the garbage. All plastics contain harmful chemicals that can leach into your food when they’re heated. Before reheating food in a microwave, transfer it from a plastic container to a plate or glass dish.

Scrap metal,Scrap metal,"Scrap metal is one of the most valuable products you can recycle, and it encompasses so many consumer products. From appliances to batteries to cans to clothes hangers, metal is everywhere in our homes. Recycling metal is important to not only keep this limited supply material out of landfills, but also because it can make you money. 1: With scrap metal, the general rule is a product needs to be at least 50 percent metal. Even if that metal is surrounded by other materials like plastic, it’s worth recycling if it’s made mostly out of metal. 2: If you have products with only a small amount of metal but it’s easy to remove, separate the metal. For example, a plastic three-ring binder is not scrap metal, but remove the metal rings and now you’re talking. 3; Scrap metal is classified as either ferrous (containing iron, such as steel) and nonferrous (everything else). So, you’ll want to identify whether your metal is ferrous or nonferrous. The way to do this is with a magnet. Ferrous metals stick to a magnet; nonferrous metals don’t. 4: Use Earth911’s recycling directory to find a scrap metal recycler, and contact the company or visit its webpage to find out current payouts and if there’s a minimum amount of material you need to bring. 5: Most scrap metal recyclers will require you to bring identification when you recycle. This is to prevent people from stealing scrap metal (e.g., road signs, metal barriers) and selling it for scrap. Most cities will only accept metal cans (aluminum and steel) in the curbside recycling program. Other metals are only collected curbside if your city provides bulky waste pick-up. You’ll need to call to schedule this pick-up and tell the hauler what you have — bulky waste pick-up usually accepts miscellaneous scrap (e.g., ironing boards, aluminum bats, silverware) as well as large scrap (e.g., appliances and electronics).",75%

Throw away the package and any non-recyclable caps. Plastic tubes, e.g. for hand cream and lotions, are increasingly being made from plastics which can be recycled. Therefore if your local authority collects pots, tubs and trays, you can generally include tubes.

In general they are not recyclable, although there have been breakthroughs including by Colgate and Terracyle offer a recycling scheme for oral care products. Pump action toothpaste tubes are easier to recycle and can be placed in the recycling if your local authority also collects plastic pots, tubs and trays. 3:  Plastic items that are less than 40 x 40mm are unlikely to be recycled because they will fall out of the recycling process in a step that is designed to remove small items of dirt and contamination.",29%

Pizza box,Carton,"The best way to recycle pizza boxes is to discard any leftover food in your organics collection bin before putting the box in the recycling. Any heavily greased cardboard can be torn off and put in the trash before putting the clean cardboard in the recycling stream.  Pizza boxes are normally made from corrugated cardboard which is recyclable. However most pizza boxes have food debris attached to them and a lot of grease. The grease prevents the paper fibers from binding during the recycling process and this results in a poor quality paper product. This also happens when paper plates and used paper napkins are recycled.

If the recyclable load becomes contaminated with the grease from pizza boxes then the whole load will be sent to landfill, which is a dire consequence for your sustainability goals.

The best way to recycle pizza boxes is to discard any leftover food in your organics collection bin before putting the box in the recycling. Any heavily greased cardboard can be torn off and put in the trash before putting the clean cardboard in the recycling stream. 1: Ideal locations include anywhere pizza gets regularly consumed including cafeterias, common areas, meeting rooms and dorm room buildings for students. 2: Select the right size container for the amount of pizza boxes being generated in your facility. 3: Launch the program to your employees, customers or students so they are aware that they can now toss pizza bins into the organics stream or in the recycling. 4; Customize the container to suit the bulky nature of pizza boxes. If possible the best solution is one that encourages stacking of the boxes to prevent bottle necks. 5: Continue to communicate the program after launch, and report on the progress so everyone can see how much waste is being diverted from landfill.",35%

This is why recycling programs commonly accept only container glass.Soda-lime glass is used in everything from jars to windows. It’s the most common type of glass produced. While your glass cups and wine glasses are likely made from soda-lime glass, they aren’t recyclable in most places. This is because manufacturers use additives to adjust the glass for its intended purpose. You’ve probably noticed that wine glasses break more easily than a soda bottle or a pickle jar. This is because the composition of the glass is slightly different. Even if it’s recyclable container-type glass, don’t put any broken glass in your recycling bin. Broken glass is a hazard to workers who collect and sort your recyclables. So, the only option is to throw it away. Since it’s also a hazard to trash collectors, here’s the best way to handle it: 1:  Wrap up the broken glass in newspaper or cloth and place it inside a small cardboard box. Pour any other small broken glass inside the box. 2: Stuff any additional newspaper into the box so the glass can’t bounce around as easily. 3:Tape the box closed securely and write “Broken Glass” on the outside. 4:  Throw the box into the trash bin.
